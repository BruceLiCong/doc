design a new github branching model with cherry-pick

; branching model : origin 6.x is a synced clean copy from upstream 6.x, it needs to update periodically.
                  : origin 6.x-local is the  develop branch of 6.x on origin, which is checked out from origin 6.x.
		    origin 6.x-local has many customized commits you don't want to send as pull-requests.
git branch -a
  upstream 6.x
  origin   6.x
  origin   6.x-local


; sync the upstream to clean copy 6.x on origin, git will merge fast-forward-ly every time
git checkout 6.x
git pull upstream 6.x
git push origin 6.x


; sync origin 6.x to 6.x-local
git checkout 6.x-local
git merge 6.x


; develop on local 6.x-local
git checkout 6.x-local
  .. develop & commit with REVHASH


; send clean pull request
git checkout 6.x
git checkout -b pull-request-branch
git cherry-pick REVHASH
  .. you may need to merge the conflicts genrated by cherry-pick, similar with git rebase process
  .. send a pull request on the pull-request-branch in github web gui
