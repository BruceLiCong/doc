if you are working on branch X, sometimes you reset your head and want to recover it



git reset HEAD^ --hard,,,,

if HEAD is on remote
   git pull ..
else
   you can recover only if you remember the revision hash rev-hash
   git checkout rev-hash // checkout at file level will create a detached branch, use `git branch -v` to check this.
   git checkout -b newbranch // the branch is checkedout from detached branch, and contains the HEAD you want to recover.
   git checkout X // back to your working branch
   git merge newbranch // no need to commit
