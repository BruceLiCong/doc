if you work on gerrit and want to fix on something which is already pushed and created on a branch to remote
there are 2 method

1. `git commit --amend`
   this will not change the local git commit id and the hooks will help you.
2. `git rebase -i rev-hash` or `git rebase -i master`
   to re-edit the commit history and use `fixup` or `f` for short to mark the fixed commit, 
   git will replay the commit history, and append the fixed commit to the earlier one.
   finally hooks on gerrit will help you.
